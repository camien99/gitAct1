# Grades

## Meets Requirements: 20%

* Overlapping schedules requirement not implemented.
* Capacity requirement not implemented.
* ```Room``` should not be an enumeration type, since a school would have too many rooms, and these rooms and their names tend to change over time.


## Test-Driven Development: 15%

* No new tests were created.

## Readability: 20%

* Very little new code was created.

## Object-Oriented Design Principles: 20%

* No new classes or methods were created except for ```Room``` enum, so there's nothing to check.

## Coding Practices: 15%

* ```studentTest.java```: first letter should be capitalized according to Java naming convention

## Version Control & Continuous Integration Practices: 10%
