# Grades

## Meets Requirements: 0/20%

* Overlapping schedules requirement not implemented.

## Test-Driven Development: 0/15%

* No new tests were created.

## Readability: 0/20%

* Very little new code was created.

## Object-Oriented Design Principles: 0/20%

* No new classes or methods were created except for ```Room``` enum, so there's nothing to check.

## Coding Practices: 0/15%

* ```studentTest.java```: first letter should be capitalized according to Java naming convention
* Very little new code was created
